COMP 3410 PA2 - Part 1 writeup
1) There were four or five truly program-breaking errors in the code. Most of them were centered around wrongly used or nonexistent labels, with one involving storing an argument into $v0 instead of $a0 and another using an incorrect instruction.
2) The program would initially not do any loops because of the use of stl instead of stli. However, upon fixing that command, only three loops were executed when four were needed. The program begins by adding the first number to zero, which burns through an extra iteration. I opted not to change this and stay true to the initial (theoretical) programmer's logic and simply increase the loop counter by one to compensate.
3) Honestly? Mildly easier. Thanks to the briefing in the description of part one and the length of the program, there wasn't much to go through and check out. The use of subroutines for printing made checking for proper arguments and proper syscall easier. The use of hex numbers and register numbers was a bit off-putting, but easily fixed. There wasn't anything particularly brain-twisting about this problem, though being bored at work probably helped me chew through it a bit faster than normal.
