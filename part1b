Part 1-B

* Approximately how many errors did you find and have to correct?
About 7 errors. Including additional code that was not present but was referenced in the instructions.


* Why did the program not perform all the iterations as expected?
Because it was set to perform 3 iterations instead of four, plus the shifts and jumps where innacurate.

* How much easier would the program have been to debug if it had been commented?
A lot easier. Commenting a code allows a better debugging not only for the coder but for your coleagues and supervisors.
