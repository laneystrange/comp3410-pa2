* Approximately how many errors did you find and have to correct?
around 6 erros, which count to 8 lines of code.

* Why did the program not perform all the iterations as expected?
Because on line 19, the loop was $s1 < 3 instead of $s1 < 4 or $s1 <= 3;

* How much easier would the program have been to debug if it had been commented?
A lot easier. I wouldn't have to go through each single instruction to figure what it was doing.
