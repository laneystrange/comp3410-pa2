There were six changes that needed to be made,
 including adding 'i's for working with immediates, 
 changing numbers for loop counters, 
 and adding a new method within the code itself to print integers.

 The reason the program didn't perform all iterations as expected was
 a logic error when looping through. It was only performing 3 iterations
 and thus only adding 3 of the 4 numbers.
 
 The program would have been incredibly easier to fix if there were comments.
 Without comments, you must go through the logic of the code step by step
 in order to understand what the programmer is trying to do and thus
 to understand what is actually wrong with the code.
