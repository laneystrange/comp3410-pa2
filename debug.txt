So I think that there are six things I changed:


 1. change $v0 --> $a0 (arg is a string)
 2. slt ---> slti  (adding 'i's for working with immediates)  
 3. jal writeint.  printstr  ---> writeint because $s1 contains int
 4. slti $s2, $s1, 0x03 -> slti $s2, $s1, 0x04 (It only iterated three times, instead of 4)
 5 . #writeint was not found in the symbol table. So,wrote a writeint call.
 6. j _exit #_exit not found in symbols table. Changing from j _exit to using li $v0, 10 and then doing a syscall
 
 
 

The reason is about a logic error when looping through. It was only performing 3 iterations
so it only add 3 numbers instead of 4.
 
 The program would have been incredibly easier to fix if there were comments.
 Because if there are comments we can easily understand and read each step how the program
 running. And it also make it easily to debug and see where we gone wrong.
