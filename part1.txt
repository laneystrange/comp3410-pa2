:PART ONE:

These are all the changes I made, so question 1 is: 6.

1. In the label 'end', the jump to _exit is invalid, and so we change it to jump to an exit label, which we had to make as well.
2. There is no 'writeint' label. I added it and made it do what we expect it to do.
3. The 'slt' line needs to be 'slti', and it needs to be comparing against 4, or we will only get three iterations.
4. The loading of the welcome string is originally into the syscall register, it had to be moved to the arguments register.
5. We need to go to 'writeint' for printing our current iterator register, not 'printstr'.
6. The 'end' label is very broken. We need to load $s4, our running total, into the arguments register. Then we need to go to 'writeint', then we exit.

The program didn't iterate enough times because it was seeing if our counter was *less* than three, not less-equal to 3. I changed it to 4, so we go 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> fail on 4, which is four iterations.

The program would have been a lot easier to troubleshoot without commenting, so much so that in order to troubleshoot it effectively I had to comment it first, just to understand what was happening.
