Problem 1a: 

	Output:		
		Welcome to the mysterious MIPS Program
		Iteration: 1
		Iteration: 2
		Iteration: 3
		Iteration: 4
		100
		-- program is finished running --

Problem 1b:
		I found a total of six errors that needed to be corrected.

		The program didn't perform all the iterations because the slt instruction at the beginning of the loop was set to 3 when it should be 4.
		Also the slt instruction is an R-Type instruction.

		Instead of 20 minutes to figure it out, it would have probably taken 10 mins. Otherwise, comments would have been icing on the cake but
		they weren't really needed because the program wasn't very complex.
