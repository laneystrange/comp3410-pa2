THis is Matt Maddox and this is my PA2 for assembly.

For Question 1 the outputs I am getting are:
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
100

For Question 2 the my buffer array with my intergers from my text file PA_Input1.txt file are being read and put into a byte "array". Then when the program runs it is creating a sortedtest.txt file and trying to fill the file with the sorted intergers in ascending order.
