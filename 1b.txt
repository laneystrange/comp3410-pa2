Approximately how many errors did you find and have to correct?
	
	I would say somewhere around 20
	
Why did the program not perform all the iterations as expected?

	Initially it did not assemble once fixed it did not iterate the right number of times, because the marker was not ready
	
How much easier would the program have been to debug if it had been commented?

	Comments would have made debugging the code much easier than it was.
