Approximately how many errors did you find and have to correct?

- 10 errors, give or take a few. It depends on whether you clumped printing as one error or broke it down line by line.

Why did the program not perform all the iterations as expected?

- The main problem was that the program didn't have correct "jal" being used. Just reading it, you are hopping all over the code.

How much easier would the program have been to debug if it had been commented?

- The code would have been MUCH easier to interpret and fix. Comments allow programmers to easily pickup on what a code is trying to accomplish and detailed  comments allow coders to see bugs with relative ease.
