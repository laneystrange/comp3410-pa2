1.Approximately how many errors did you find and have to correct?

There were about 8 problems that were critical to the having the program run 
properly. Most of them were syntax issues, however there were other errors
that required multiple lines being changed. These were that the code for "writeint"
had to be written (3 additional lines) and the end label had to be moved to the 
very end of the program. The 3 lines that were originally under the end label
were changed to 2 lines that terminated the program properly. Additional changes
were made to the program in order to have the total appear after every iteration 
instead of just displaying it one per the instructions. This offers more evidence that
the program is working correctly.

2.Why did the program not perform all the iterations as expected?

The original program used the expression 'slt $s2, $s1,0x03' to track the counter.
There is a syntax error that prevented the program from even assembling at first;
even if the integer 3 was stored in a register and the register was used int the 
slt instruction the loop would execute one time less than it was supposed to. There
are four numbers that need to be added to the cumulative total therefore since the
counter starts at 0 the counter must include 3 . Therefore the slt statement was 
modified to 'slt $s2, $s1, $t0' where $t0 holds the value 4.

3.How much easier would the program have been to debug if it had been commented?

The program would have been alot easier to debug if there were comments. The 
program was not bad to debug because most of the code was segmented with a few 
jumps, however when dealing with the jumps and conditional statements it gets 
a little confusing when trying to move back and forth between the code snippets.
Having a synopsis of the lines of code makes reviewing and debuggin code a lot 
easier than not having comments.
