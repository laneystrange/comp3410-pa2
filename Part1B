 1. 	I found 6 errors

1.1.Error:#slt $s2, $s1, 0x04	# Slt is R type instraction and 			the loop need to run 4 times not 3 times
	Corrction: i put 0X04 in register $t0 and the instraction 			slt $s2, $s1, $t0
1.2. Error: jal printstr 		
  corection: change jal printstr to jal writeint 

1.3. Error: j_exit	 is not the right instraction			
	correction: Change j_exit	to j exit	 corection for j_exit
1.4 Error: move $4, $20 there is no such type of registers
	Correction: change to register $a0 and $s4 
 	
1.5. Error:The program was without "writeint:" block
	Corection:  i creat writeint: block.  

1.6. Error: The program was without exit block
	Correction: Creat exit block


2. Becuse the loop start from 0 and stop at 2. this will get 	lost the last iteration

3. It would be so easy to debug if it was commented. Because the 	reader can understand the code so easly.
